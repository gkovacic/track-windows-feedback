# Toggl Track Windows Application

### ❓ What's up?

We've finally released the BETA for our fully native Windows app. 🎉 

### 🧰 How can you help?

This repository will serve as an additional hub for the user feedback during the BETA testing, and beyond!
So, if you find some issues with the application, let us know by creating issues in this repository.

We can't promise to reply to each and every issue, but we will read through every one of them so we can make sure we deliver the best app experience we can.

> An alternative way to report issues is from the app itself, by opening the cog-wheel menu (on the title bar) and choosing `Send Feedback` item, then follow instructions.
