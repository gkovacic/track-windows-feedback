# Toggl Track Windows Application

### ❓ What's up?

We've finally released the newly rewritten native Windows app. 🎉 

Download the new app here: :floppy_disk: [Toggl Track Windows Client x64](https://toggl.com/track/toggl-desktop/downloads/windows/stable/TogglTrack-windows64.exe).

### 🧰 How can you help?

This repository will serve as a kind of hub for the user feedback related to our new app!
So, if you find some issues with the application, let us know by creating issues in this repository. (You can also contact our support directly).

We can't promise to reply to each and every issue here, but we will read through every one of them so we can make sure we deliver the best app experience we can.

> An alternative way to report issues is from the app itself, by opening the cog-wheel menu (on the title bar) and choosing `Send Feedback` item, then follow instructions.
