# Toggl Track Windows Application

🎉 We've finally released the BETA for our fully native Windows app.

### What's up?

Here are some improvements that we've done:

* 📝 Improved UI for editing your time entries
* 🔍 Improved search capabilities
* ↩️ `#` and `@` shortcuts for easier selection of projects and tags
* 🕥 Improved mini timer

Some of the features you use and love are not yet present in this BETA because we're improving them too. We'll release them as part of the BETA release as soon as we're happy with them. We are sure you'll be happy too!

Stay tuned for updates on the improvements on your favorite features:
* 📆 Extended calendar view
* ⚙️ Autotracking
* 🍅 Pomodoro
* ... and more!

### How can you help?

This repository will serve as a hub for the user feedback during the BETA testing, and beyond!

So, if you find some issues with the application, let us know by creating an issue in this repository.

We can't promise to reply to each and every issue, but we will read through every one of them so we can make sure we deliver the best app experience we can.

> An alternative way to report issues is from the app itself, by opening the cog-wheel menu (on the title bar) and choosing `Send Feedback` item, then follow instructions.
